# Tocepi

Game project for last year of upper secondary school.

The task is set to, after a year of other C++ projects, create something of our own. Preferably a game. 
This is set to be a 2D Action Adventure game. Where as the player are to wander around on either 
multiple maps or a single map. Which to use is still undetermined. Nonetheless they are to be loaded in by
my own tilemap loader.

The loading of the tilemap is setup to easily be changed depending on map file where examples of this could be txt, json or xml files.
